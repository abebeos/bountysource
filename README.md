Counter the Embezzlement of Developer Owned Money by Bountysource

https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bountysource

## Overview

Bountysource is an US based company that provides a so called Bounty-Platform with a simple process: 

* anyone can **PLACE** a reward (bounty) on issues, send via paypal to bountysource (money immediately available to bountysource)
* Interested developers which solve the issues can **CLAIM** the bounty.
* The bounty issuer(s) CONFIRM that the issue was fixed.
* Bountysources the **PAYS** out the bounty-ammount (system-internally) to the developer.
* The developer can then **CASHOUT** via paypal, bountysources keeps 10% for its operational costs.

## Problem

Since years, Bountysource delays the cashouts significantly, despite getting a 10% service-fee on cash-out.

An example cash-out:

https://github.com/abebeos/bountysource/issues/1

It is clear that bountysource has liquidity problems, because the funds are not used as they should (= embezzlement)

## Process

- [ ] Find out where to complain as an US Customer
- [ ] Find out where to complain as an EU Customer
- [ ] Clarify that Bountysource is a financial service (e.g. escrow), https://github.com/abebeos/bountysource/issues/2
- [ ] Where did the money go? https://github.com/abebeos/bountysource/issues/3

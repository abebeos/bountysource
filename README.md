Counter the Embezzlement of Developer Owned Money by Bountysource

https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bountysource

## Overview

Bountysource is an US based company that provides a platform where open projects can **PLACE** a reward (bountY) on issues, send via paypal to bountysource.

Interested developers which solve the issues can **CLAIM** the bounty.

The bounty amount is the **PAYED** out (system-internally) to the developer.

The developer can then **CASHOUT** via paypal

## Problem

Since years, Bountysource delays the cashouts significantly, despite getting a 10% service-fee on cash-out.

An example cash-out:

## Process

- [ ] Find out where to complain as an US Customer
- [ ] Find out where to complain as an EU Customer
- [ ] Clarify that Bountysource is a financial service (e.g. escrow), https://github.com/abebeos/bountysource/issues/2
